# Class-Schedule-Generator-Using-Genetic-Algorithm-
This mini project proposed a method based on the genetic algorithm to solve the constrained timetable problem, which helps to create theory as well as lab schedule for universities. A smart adaptive mutation scheme is used to speed up, convergence and chromosome format is also problem specific.
